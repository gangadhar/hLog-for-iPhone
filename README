hLog is an open sourced health log application for smartphones. The first version available in github is for iPhones.

I created this application since I wanted to help in finding a cure for cancer. I feel that patients collaborating with other patients will help in finding a cure for this dreadful disease which is expected to strike 1 in 2 men and 1 in 3 women according to the American Cancer Society.

Plans for hLog:
a. Integrate with HleathVault, Google Health.
b. Migrate app to Android and other smartphone platforms.
c. Let the users collaborate with each others.
